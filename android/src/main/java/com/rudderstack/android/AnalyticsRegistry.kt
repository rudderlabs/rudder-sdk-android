/**
 * AnalyticsRegistry is a singleton object responsible for managing and providing instances of the Analytics class.
 * It maintains a mapping between write keys and Analytics instances using concurrent hash maps.
 *
 * The class provides methods for registering new Analytics instances with unique write keys,
 * as well as retrieving instances based on write keys.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - To register a new Analytics instance, use the [register] method, providing a write key and the Analytics instance.
 * - To retrieve an Analytics instance, use the [getInstance] method, passing the write key.
 *
 * Note: The class is marked as internal, indicating that it is intended for use within the same module and should not be accessed
 * from outside the module.
